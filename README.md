# New Vegas Damage Threshold Port - Add-on for ArtiGrok Ballisitcs for GAMMA

This is an experimental "porting" of New Vegas's damage system - Damage Resistance and Damage Threshold - *for Ballistic Damage* for my mod [ArtiGrok Ballistics for GAMMA](https://github.com/ilrathCXV/ArtiGrok-Ballistics-GAMMA-ilrath-Mo3).

Currently, this overhauls **the damage the Player does to a Stalker**, **the damage Stalkers do to the Player**, and **the damage Stalkers do to each other** (the latter will only work if the respective MCM option in ArtGrok is enabled).

I have included a README text file inside to try and explain all the damage calculations and my interpretations of the DR/DT system from New Vegas into GAMMA. (NOTE: Needs to be updated to better reflect the fixes made up to this point)

_**This is highly experimental and most likely makes the game much harder!!! Not having enough AP against a target will make encounters much harder!!!**_
I have put some systems in place to help alleviate said issues, but they are not perfect.

This is not going to replace ArtiGrok's calculations in the future. This is purely an experiment and fun project I wanted to tackle. Leave feedback for anyone brave enough to try a SUPER experimental mod.
